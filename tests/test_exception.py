    # Step 1: the exception itself
    # `pytest.raises(...)` is a context manager that *expects* the block to
    # raise the given exception. If it does → test passes. If it raises
    # something else → test fails. If it raises nothing → test fails too.
    # `as exc_info` captures a handle on the raised exception for later checks.
    with pytest.raises(NotFoundException) as exc_info:
        # `get_by_id` is `async def`, so we `await` it. The `await` lives
        # *inside* the `with` block — that's the call we expect to raise.
        await employee_service.employee_by_id(db_session, 9999)

    # Step 2: details about the exception
    # `exc_info.value` is the actual exception object (a NotFoundException).
    # Our base `AppException` exposes `.detail` — we assert the missing ID
    # appears in it, locking in "this exception with this content", not just
    # "some NotFoundException was raised somewhere".
    assert "9999" in exc_info.value.detail
